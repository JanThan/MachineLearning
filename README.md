# LearningML
A documentation of my route in learning ML  
  
Below is a list of the resources that I have used or referred to:  
- [How to Learn Machine Learning](https://elitedatascience.com/learn-machine-learning)
- [Pattern Recognition by SERGIOS THEODORIDIS and KONSTANTINOS KOUTROUMBAS](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/blob/master/PatternRecognition.pdf)

I have fully completed Andrew Ng's very indepth [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on coursera. 
Whilst old, it still seems to cover the fundamentals very well. The assignments I completed as part of this course can be found [linked](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/tree/master/AndrewNg_MLCourse).  

Following this, I went onto tackle some of the commonly suggested projects to further solidify what I had learnt from the course.  
- [Iris Flowers Classification ML Project](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/tree/master/IRIS)
- [Boston Housing Prices Estimate Project](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/tree/master/BostonHousingProblem)
- [Compressive Strength of Concrete](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/tree/master/CompressiveStrengthOfConcrete)
- [Predicting Forest Fires](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/tree/master/PredictingForestFires)

# Neural Networks
I also began to learn how to implement neural networks.  [Initial Learning](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/tree/master/NeuralNetwork).
I worked on applying this to various datasets:
- [cifar-10 dataset](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/tree/master/cifar10_dataset)

# Dissertation  
Following the above learning, I spent the next year focused on my final year dissertation. [Adversarial Image Classification using Deep Neural Rejection]().  
It focuses on the topic of building a robust CNN which is resistant to adversarial attacks using researched methods.
