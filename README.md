# LearningML
A documentation of my route in learning ML  
  
Below is a list of the resources that I have used or referred to:  
- [How to Learn Machine Learning](https://elitedatascience.com/learn-machine-learning)
- [Pattern Recognition by SERGIOS THEODORIDIS and KONSTANTINOS KOUTROUMBAS](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/blob/master/PatternRecognition.pdf)

I have fully completed Andrew Ng's very indepth [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on coursera. 
Whilst old, it still seems to cover the fundamentals very well. The assignments I completed as part of this course can be found [linked](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/tree/master/AndrewNg_MLCourse).  

Following this, I went onto tackle some of the commonly suggested projects to further solidify what I had learnt from the course.  
- [Iris Flowers Classification ML Project](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/tree/master/IRIS)
- [Boston Housing Prices Estimate Project](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/tree/master/BostonHousingProblem)
- [Compressive Strength of Concrete](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/tree/master/CompressiveStrengthOfConcrete)
- [Predicting Forest Fires](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/tree/master/PredictingForestFires)

# Neural Networks
I also began to learn how to implement neural networks.  [Initial Learning](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/tree/master/NeuralNetwork).
I worked on applying this to various datasets:
- [cifar-10 dataset](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/tree/master/cifar10_dataset)

# 3rd year Group Robotics Project
My first real application of what I had learnt was in my third year of university to the group robotics project.  
The task was to create an automonous system capable of tracking 'rogue' droids, identify the error signal, to then immobilise safely and return to a designated 'maintenance' area.  
See [3rd year group robotics project](https://github.com/JanThan/MachineLearning/tree/main/3rd%20Year%20Group%20Robotics%20Project)
My specific contribution to this was with regards to the overhead live tracking of multiple droids, followed by the detection of their error codes via the use of OpenCV and Tensorflow.   

# Dissertation  
Following the above learning, I spent the next year focused on my final year dissertation. [Adversarial Image Classification using Deep Neural Rejection](https://github.com/JanThan/MachineLearning/tree/main/FinalYearDissertation).  
It focuses on the topic of building a robust CNN which is resistant to adversarial attacks using researched methods.
