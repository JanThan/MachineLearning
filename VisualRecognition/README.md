# VisionScripts
Repository focused on displaying some examples of work I have done concerning:  
- Object Detection followed by Tracking  
Program will first detect the trained object within an environment. On User command, it will then begin to track the detected region of interest.

- Colour Detection for error code detection  
Program will run through live video feed and record detected colours into an array to then check against pre-defined error codes

- Map Creation  
Script used to create turn a capture of the maze (for project scenario) into a binary image for automated mapping  
  
Note: MultiDetectionTracking Script is an 'in progress' work with the aim of combining all the above into one functioning script. This is the most clean and logical to follow script, but lacks some functionality which will be added in future uploads.
