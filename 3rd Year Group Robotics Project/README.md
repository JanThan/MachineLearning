This is the end result of our NovaBot which I had contributed to the development of.   
The task was specifically to create an automonous system capable of tracking 'rogue' droids, identify the error signal, to then immobilise safely and return to a designated 'maintenance' area.  
My specific contribution to this was with regards to the overhead live tracking of multiple droids, followed by the detection of their error codes via the use of OpenCV and Tensorflow. See 1:09 (Puck Detection) to 1:30 (Visual Error Code Detection) of the group project video.  
Files which specifically relate to each of these tasks can be found in their relevant folders.
